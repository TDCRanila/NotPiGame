This character needs no introduction.  If you don't know what a Protoss Zealot is, and you are a game player, then you need help.  Just in case, though, check out www.blizzard.com or www.battle.net.  They're bound to have info.

Anyway, on to an explanation of the model.  This thing started, and was basically finished quite a few months ago (as of november 1999).  The delay was due to me not mapping or texturing it.  It originally had ~900 polys, but Wrath looked at it and cleaned it up (thanks!).  It was my first low-poly model, so I'm sure my next will be brilliantly optimized all by my lonesome ;).  He shaved off over 100 polys.  Then, Whisp volunteered to map it, and he did a hell of a job.  If you make any new skins, send them to me!  Abhoth then made a couple skins, one orange and one metallic.

I am really poor at 2d -- it is something I'm working on.  However, a limited palette is beyond my current abilities, so rather than hacking his skins to make two new CTF skins, I just renamed his by the appropriate color.

Overall, I think people will be happy with the model and animations.  One complaint I know I'm going to get is that he slides a little.  I know, and I'm sorry.  The reason I made his run animation like I did is because I wanted to get a "I'm a badass and am going to kick your ass" macho-walk, rather than the hurrying "gotta run shoot run shoot" look.  If you look at the model with that image in mind, it works quite well I think.  On another note, zealots don't have guns, so neither does mine.  He has psi blades.  It looks really cool if you see someone attacking with single-shot weapons like a blaster, but on high-ROF weapons like the machine gun, his arms pose kinda funky.  Oh well, no way around that.

One last thing, I originally had the hair off, because 900 was way too high.  Wrath added it when he optimized it, but he did not animate it.  So, here are the credits for the model:

Wrath: Further Optimization and Hair Model
Whisp: Skin Vertex Mapping
Abhoth:  Texture Mapping

ENJOY!!!
