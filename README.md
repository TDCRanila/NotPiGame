## **About**

‘PiGame’ was a Y1 solo student project and was developed for the Raspberry Pi 3B within eight weeks. (Thus the code is quite old.) The original project was about programming on embedded systems, target-based programming, and learning about basic engine programming. The repository here contains modified code of the original Raspberry Pi project, as it has been ported over to work on Windows.

The project was more of a tech-demo showing of a C++ custom framework and a small game on the Raspberry Pi. It taught me basic engine structure and it helped improve my C++ skills. Some of the code and decisions were definitely questionable, but making mistakes is fine, as long that you learn from them.

The game itself is fairly minimal as it was made quickly, but shows functional gameplay on the system. The game itself was inspired by the old DOOM and Quake games.

## **Tech**

Although the code is far from my own personal quality standards nowadays, I did learn and implement some nice things back then.

- Researched and implemented engine related systems.
- Programming for Embedded Systems, in this case the Raspberry Pi.
  - Limited Hardware Performance.
  - Resource Management.
  - Input Management.
  - (Window) Rendering.
  - Target-Based Programming.
- OpenGL ES Rendering.
- [MD2s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD2_(file_format)) Loading & Playing Animation.
- Stack-Based Finite State Machine.
- Basic (Raycasting) Collision Detection.
